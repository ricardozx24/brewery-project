    <p class="history">Leadership is exactly what the definition of the word is. The act of LEADING a group of people.  By leading you allow your team to be true to themselves, allow them to fall every now and then, allow them to learn from mistakes, but mostly to inspire them to be the very best version of themselves. Being a leader means standing in front to take the hits so they don't have to, but following behind when it comes time for a spotlight to shine so you can help build them into what they are meant to be.</p> 
      <p class="history">Supporting and giving guidance to help others succeed.</p>
      <p class="history">One who is able to direct and motivate the team to do the job for the day. Resolve issues. Encourage but also discipline. 
      Someone that has compassion , is candid , listens,  trustworthily and is Respectful to everyone.</p>
      <p class="history">
      Leadership is the ability to inspire others to achieve goals and drive them to get results and motivate them to do better every day at the same time you take care of them, and their needs as much as your possibilities allow, being always open and ready to serve those under your charge.</p>
      <p class="history">Being someone that everyone trusts to make decisions for the greater good.  It is also about growing your influence and helping people be the best version of themselves.</p>
      <p class="history">To me, leadership is inspiring and guiding others towards achieving a common goal, all while fostering growth, accountability, and a supportive inclusive environment.  It's something we have to work on each day as it doesn't come easy.  We must constantly remind ourselves and remember why we chose this role each and every time we step through that front door.  It's about the people.</p>
      <p class="history">Just about anyone can be taught a process or learn new skills, but when it comes to dealing with people, you either have the want/desire to help and support others or you don't.  Leadership can't be taught, you either have it or you don't.
      I'll end with this; the best workers don't always make the best leaders just like the best leaders don't always make the best workers.</p>
      <p class="history">Leadership is a skill that is developed over time as a member of management.  Leading, advising, teaching, training, and making a difference in someone's life or in an organization.</p>
      <p class="history">Leadership to me is number one, taking care of a group of AutoZoners and providing them with the knowledge to help depending on the department of how to be a spoke in the wheel of an organization and reach a goal for Customer satisfaction.  A leader drives this group and is there to support them in any way he or she can to help them be successful.  Provide training and guidance and build a team that does their part.</p>
      <p class="history">To me leadership is to take care of your AutoZoners and make them feel comfortable and feel happy to come to work. Help them understand that is a business and to stay productive.</p>
      <p class="history"> Leadership is caring about people. Hearing them out, and addressing/explaining why something isn’t or won’t be, or if given information that can be utilized to make a team/dept. stronger to actually apply that information. Whether that’s feedback follow-up or application.

  <p class="history">
    Knowing when to push and when to chip in to take some of the workload
    off your team.
  </p>
  <p class="history">
    Leading by example - It is very easy to tell people what to do but it is much more difficult to go out there and show them the how's and why's.
  </p>
  <p class="history" style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;">*** Practice what you preach. ***</p>
  <p class="history">If you do not lead by example, then your directions or guidance as a leader bears no weight as your team will not be bought into what you are doing because you are not even bought into it.
  </p>
  <p class="history">
    A leader needs to be humble, think about the team needs and setting the ego aside being receptive to any type of input, capable of accepting your mistakes because no one is perfect and know that there is always something you can learn from the person in front of you.
  </p>
  <p class="history">
    Is very important to have the ability to understand the others perspective and get in their shoes, once you understand how they see the different situations more than likely you will be able to communicate more effectively.
  </p>
  <p class="history">
    You can't effectively lead or solve issues if you can't listen. Empathy & Sympathy - you must learn both and understand the difference between the two so that you can make the best decision for both the person and the company.
  </p>
  <p class="history">
    Most important is being a people person or at least a person who is approachable.   Must be able to listen and be there for your team.
  </p>
  <p class="history">
    Making sure the business is running is one thing, but the ability to do that while synergizing that with getting people to love the work they are doing, not having them feel as though they are being “picked on”, and fostering a desire for success is an achievement to be proud of. It is the difference of compliance vs. commitment.
