      <p class="history">Be Consistent and Reliable: As a leader and example for others we need to be consistent in what we say and follow this with our actions, this will help build trust and influence over those who we lead.</p>
      <p class="history">Follow-up and follow through.  Showing the why and reminding everyone of the results of our efforts.</p>
      <p class="history">Be fair and equal, hold everyone accountable and don't show bias.</p>
      <p class="history">Stay in the teaching mode and stay focused on being consistent when dealing with all your AutoZoners.  It's easy to show more attention to those that are always stepping up.  You must make sure you are communicating with everyone the same.  Making time for everyone.</p>
      <p class="history">Standing their ground on what they believe should be happening, accountability on their actions and holding those they lead accountable to theirs, Fostering growth in their people.</p>

      What leadership styles would best describe you?

      <p class="history">Relating back to the leadership characteristics, I would describe my leadership style as a servant leader. I always try to be "out in the trenches" with my team. As mentioned before, it is easy to tell people what to do but it is much more difficult to go out and be a part of the process. It is my belief that it is much easier to get your team bought into what you are trying to accomplish if you show them that not only do you truly understand the process but also that you care enough to help them along the way.</p>
      <p class="history">Puts the team first, encourages, motivates, cares for each person, and loves them as individuals. Hits the goals for the day.</p>
      <p class="history">I think I'm a mix People come 1st style and Coaching style.</p>
      <p class="history">Participative and servant leadership.</p>
      <p class="history">Servant Leadership.  This is a style I learned and honed in on in my previous job.  A servant leader prioritizes the needs of the team and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible.  You take care of the people on your team; they will take care of you.</p>
      <p class="history">Situation Leadership, but I lean heavy on Bureaucratic (because weâ€™re a company that leans to be strict with policy) and Transformational Leadership (I enjoy challenging others and my own way of seeing things.).</p>
